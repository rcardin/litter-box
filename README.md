# litter-box

A distrustful autonomous coding loop for JVM projects.

It picks one labelled GitHub issue, dispatches a fresh `claude -p` worker inside a
network-restricted Docker sandbox, gates the result, has a **cold independent reviewer** judge the
diff, opens a PR, and lets CI decide. The model never picks its own task and never reports its own
success.

Extracted from the `harness/` directory of
[functional-event-sourcing-with-yaes](https://github.com/rcardin/functional-event-sourcing-with-yaes)
and being generalized into an installable tool. See [#1](https://github.com/rcardin/litter-box/issues/1)
for the design record.

## Not installable yet

There is no `litter-box` binary and no `litter-box init` yet. What slice 2 added is the tie-cutting:
the loop finds its repo with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` instead of assuming it lives inside one,
and every repo-specific value now comes from `.litter-box/config.conf` instead of a literal in the
source. The scaffold command (`#4`) and a published binary (`#6`) still come later.
**If you are looking for something to install, come back after [#1](https://github.com/rcardin/litter-box/issues/1) closes.**

## Configuration

One HOCON file at the repo root, `.litter-box/config.conf`. It is mandatory: with no config the loop
exits `50` (infra fault) and names `litter-box init`, rather than guessing and acting on the wrong
labels. Anything omitted falls back to the reference schema in `src/Settings.scala`; every knob
loop.sh took from an env var (`GATE_CMD`, `REPAIR_BUDGET`, `ITER_TIMEOUT`, ...) still overrides its
config key for a single run, so the layering is **env var > config file > reference default**.

```hocon
instance-name = "litter-box"          # namespaces the Docker image/network/proxy/cache names
conventions   = "CONTEXT.md"          # spliced into the review prompt as {{CONVENTIONS}}
stop-file     = "STOP.md"
log-dir       = ".litter-box/logs"

gate {
  fast    = "sbt -Werror compile test"
  timeout = 900
}
issues.labels { ready = "ready", active = "in-progress", blocked = "blocked" }
protect  = [".litter-box/**", ".github/**", "CONTEXT.md"]
budgets  { repair = 2, max-patch-bytes = 1000000 }
timeouts { iter = 1800, ci-wait = 900, ci-appear = 300, ci-appear-interval = 10 }
```

`instance-name` earns its place even though litter-box never runs two instances at once:
`sandbox/start-proxy.sh` does `docker rm -f "$PROXY_NAME"` at startup, before any issue label is
read, so with machine-global names a mistaken second launch kills the running instance's proxy
mid-iteration and no label discipline can prevent it.

## The pipeline

Fixed, not pluggable:

```
PICK → IMPLEMENT → GATE → REPAIR → REVIEW → PR → CI → MERGE
```

One issue per iteration. `PICK` resumes an `in-progress` issue if there is one, else takes the
oldest `ready` one — deterministic, no LLM involved.

## The safety spine

This is the product. Everything else is plumbing.

- **The worker never picks its own work.** The issue comes from a label query, not from the model.
- **Protected-path patch guard.** A patch touching any glob in the config's `protect` list is
  rejected unapplied. A consumer `protect` list can only widen the protection, never narrow it: the
  reference entries are unioned in as a floor, so the list always covers `.litter-box/**`, i.e. the
  config file that defines the list. The loop cannot be talked into loosening its own guard, editing
  its own CI, or rewriting the conventions it is judged against.
- **Test-tamper check.** The diff is measured against `origin/main` with `git apply --numstat` and
  the result is handed to the reviewer, which catches the classic failure mode: deleting a failing
  test to go green.
- **Cold independent reviewer.** A separate `claude -p` with none of the worker's context. It sees
  the diff, the acceptance criteria, the conventions and the tamper report, and must emit a
  `VERDICT:` sentinel. **No sentinel is treated as REQUEST_CHANGES**, never as approval.
- **Bounded self-repair.** A shared budget (default 2) per issue, spent by a RED gate *or* a
  `REQUEST_CHANGES`. A pathological issue terminates instead of looping.
- **Infra faults are not code failures.** A Docker outage, a timed-out worker or a failed merge
  exits `50` with the budget untouched and the issue left `in-progress`, so the next tick resumes it.
  A crashed sandbox can never burn repair budget or trigger a FIX.
- **`STOP.md` is a manual kill switch.** The loop reads it and never writes it.
- **The sandbox carries no credentials.** Non-root user, egress only through an allowlisting proxy.

## Exit codes

Each iteration ends in one of seven states. The driver maps them to a process exit code:

| State | rc | Process | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Success | 0 | *continues* | Merged, or PR opened → `needs-review` |
| ManualStop | 10 | 0 | `STOP.md` present |
| Idle | 11 | 0 | No `ready` or `in-progress` issue |
| DryRun | 20 | 0 | `DRY_RUN=1` stop point, before any mutation |
| NothingMade | 30 | 1 | Empty patch — nothing staged |
| NeedsHuman | 40 | *continues* | Budget spent, guard rejection, or CI red. PR left open for audit |
| InfraFault | 50 | 50 | Infra problem. Issue stays `in-progress` |

`Success` and `NeedsHuman` are the only two that let the driver advance to the next iteration;
every other state exits the process immediately. The loop runs at most `MAX_ITERS` iterations.

## Running it

```bash
scala-cli test .     # the test suite: no Docker, no gh, no credentials
scala-cli run .      # the loop itself
```

Everything is configured by environment variable — there are no CLI arguments.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_ITERS` | `1` | Iterations before the driver stops |
| `DRY_RUN` | `0` | `1` renders the worker prompt, then stops before any mutation |
| `REPAIR_BUDGET` | `2` | Fix attempts per issue |
| `MAX_PATCH_BYTES` | `1000000` | Oversized-patch guard |
| `GATE_CMD` | `sbt -Werror compile test` | The gate (overrides `gate.fast`). Overriding it skips the whole Docker preflight |
| `GATE_TIMEOUT` | `900` | Gate timeout (seconds) |
| `ITER_TIMEOUT` | `1800` | Worker dispatch timeout |
| `CI_WAIT_TIMEOUT` / `CI_APPEAR_TIMEOUT` / `CI_APPEAR_INTERVAL` | `900` / `300` / `10` | CI polling |
| `NTFY_TOPIC` | — | ntfy.sh topic for notifications |

`IMPL_CMD`, `FIX_CMD`, `REVIEW_CMD`, `NOTIFY_CMD`, `CI_WAIT_CMD`, `CI_APPEAR_CMD` and `MERGE_CMD`
are test seams: each replaces one subprocess so the loop can be driven without Docker or GitHub.

Preflight requires `gh`, `sbt` and `claude` on `PATH`, and either `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the sandboxed worker.

### Issue labels

`ready` → `in-progress` → `needs-review` or `needs-human`. `blocked` issues carry a
`Blocked-by: #N` line and are flipped to `ready` when their dependency closes. `class-1` marks an
issue as eligible for auto-merge once CI is green.

## Layout

```
src/          the loop: Machine (state machine), Live (handlers), Caps, Domain, Main
test/         the suite, plus golden/ — the frozen log-line contract
prompts/      worker, fixer and reviewer prompt templates
sandbox/      the Docker sandbox: gate, agent and reviewer runners, egress proxy
sandbox/test/ Docker-dependent shell tests, run manually
lib/          shell helpers for the watch UI
watch.sh      live run monitor, reads the log stream and status.jsonl
```

`Machine` is a pure decision function over a `using` clause of capability traits (`Caps.scala`);
`Live.scala` holds every real side effect. That is what lets the whole suite run in memory.

### The log contract

The operator log stream is parsed by `watch.sh`, so its wording is asserted behaviour, not
decoration. `LogParitySpec` freezes it whole against the golden files in `test/golden`. To change a
log line deliberately:

```bash
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 scala-cli test .
git diff test/golden          # read this. it IS the contract change.
```

## Build

Scala 3.8.3 on JDK 21 LTS, built with scala-cli. Deliberately **not** sbt: the threat model
distrusts agent-authored build files, so the loop never couples to the build of the project it is
working on.
